Infodemic Period : End to all forward chains and fake news
A proof of concept of fake news detection via various parameters such as wording style, time relevance, link safety and whistle blower look-ups. Inspired by the Corona Virus Pandemic being escalated to an "Infodemic" as fake news spreads like wildfire and this is one step in the direction towards an idea of putting a stop to the forward chains.

Currently in closed testing within my institute to identify and fix bugs.
